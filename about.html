<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Alves Gonzalez, a passionate and aspiring web developer currently diving into the world of HTML. I'm in the early stages of my development journey,
   building a strong foundation in web design and coding. 
   My goal is to create clean, user-friendly websites that are both functional and visually appealing.</p>

<p>Although I am still learning, I am excited by the endless possibilities the web offers, 
  and I am committed to improving my skills every day. Whether it is crafting responsive layouts or writing semantic HTML, 
  I am eager to apply what I am learning in real-world projects.</p>

<p>I believe in continuous learning and am always looking for opportunities to grow and collaborate with others in the web development community.
